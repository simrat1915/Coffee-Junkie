      Greg understood that this situation would make Michael terribly
      uncomfortable. Michael simply had no idea what was about to come and even
      though Greg could prevent it from happening, he opted to let it happen. It

      wish upon anyone a million times, yet here he was knowingly letting it
      happen to one of his best friends. He rationalized that it would
      ultimately make Michael a better person and that no matter how
      uncomfortable, everyone should experience racism at least once in their
      lifetime.
